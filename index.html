										<h2 class="major">Maltese</h2>
										<p>The Maltese had been recognized as a FCI breed under the patronage of Italy in 1954, at the annual meeting in Interlaken, Switzerland. The current FCI standard is dated November 27, 1989, and the latest translation from Italian to English is dated April 6, 1998. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1888, its latest standard being from March 10, 1964. Maltese have a long and silky coat without an undercoat. Some Maltese can have curly hair, but this is considered a fault. The colour of the coat is pure white. A pale ivory tinge is permitted on the ears. In some standards, pure white coat with slight lemon markings are tolerated.The Maltese does not shed, and is therefore a good choice for people with dog allergies.Some people prefer to have the coat short. The most common cut for the Maltese is called the "puppy cut," which involves trimming or shaving the entire body to one short length.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Siberian Husky</h2>
										<p>The Siberian Husky is a medium size, dense-coat working dog breed that originated in north-eastern Siberia. This breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family. It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings. Huskies are a very active, and energetic breed whose ancestors came from the extremely cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic. Siberian Huskies were bred by the Chukchi of Northeastern Asia to pull heavy loads long distances through difficult conditions. The dogs were imported into Alaska during the Nome Gold Rush and later spread into the United States and Canada. They were initially sent to Alaska and Canada as sled dogs but rapidly acquired the status of family pets and show dogs.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Poodle</h2>
										<p>The poodle is an active, intelligent and elegant dog, squarely built, and well proportioned. To ensure the desirable squarely built appearance, the length of body measured from the breastbone to the point of the rump approximates the height from the highest point of the shoulders to the ground. The eyes should be very dark, oval in shape, and have an alert and intelligent expression. The ears should fold over close to the head, set at, or slightly below, eye level. The coat should have a naturally curly texture, dense throughout, although most show dogs have a lion-cut or other, similarly shaven look. The sizes of the Poodle breeds are determined by height, not by weight.</p>

									<h2 class="major">German Sheperd</h2>
									<p>German Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs. The breed standard height at the withers is 60–65 cm for males and 55–60 cm for females. The weight standard is 30–40 kilograms for males and 22–32 kilograms for females. They have a domed forehead, a long muzzle and a black nose. The jaws are strong with a scissor-like bite. German Sheperds have medium-sized and brown eyes with a lively, intelligent and self-assured look. The ears are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. They have a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace. The tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.German Shepherds have a variety of colors, the most common of which are tan/black and red/black. Most color varieties have black masks and black body markings which can range from a classic "saddle" to an over-all "blanket." Rarer colour variations include the sable, pure-black, pure-white, liver and blue varieties. The all-black and sable varieties are acceptable according to most standards. </p>

											<h3 class="major">Pomeranian</h3>
											<p>Pomeranians are small dogs weighing 1.9 to 3.5 kilograms and standing 13–28 cm high at the withers. They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured coat with a plumed tail set high and flat. The top coat forms a ruff of fur on the neck, which Pomeranians are well known for, and they also have a fringe of feathery fur on the hindquarters. The earliest examples of this breed were white, occasionally brown or black. Queen Victoria adopted a small red Pomeranian in 1888, which caused that color to become fashionable by the end of the 19th century. Nowadays, the Pomeranian comes in the widest variety of colors of any dog breed, including white, black, brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black and tan, brown and tan, spotted, brindle, plus combinations of those colors. The most common colors are orange, black or cream/white.</p>

											<h1 >Corgi</h1>

											<p>There are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, each named for the county in Wales where it was originated. The two breeds were recognized as one breed until 1934 when the Kennel Club recognized them as Pembroke and Cardigan. The differences between the two breeds include bone structure, body length, and size. Cardigans are the larger of the two breeds, with large rounded ears and a 12-inch-long  flowing tail set in line with the body. Though the Cardigan is allowed in more colours than the Pembroke, white should not predominate in its coat. The Cardigan is a double-coated dog where the outer coat is dense, slightly harsh in texture, and of medium length. The dog's undercoat is short, soft, and thick. The breed stands about 30 cm at the shoulder, and weighs about 14 kg. The Cardigan is alert, active, intelligent, steady, and neither shy nor aggressive.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Golden Retriever</h3>
											<p>The Golden Retriever is a large breed with a dense, wavy coat. As a dog with origins in pedigree breeding, its widespread historical popularity, some regional variations have emerged in the breed. Therefore, the three subtypes of the Golden Retriever reflect the typical variations in dimensions and coat. However, all Golden Retrievers are blonde, yellow, or gold in colour and all subtypes are susceptible to the same health problems. Golden Retrievers are very smart dogs that are loyal and friendly to their owners.</p>
