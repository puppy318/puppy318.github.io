											<h3 class="major">Pomeranian</h3>
											<p>Pomeranians are small dogs weighing 1.9 to 3.5 kilograms and standing 13â€“28 cm high at the withers. They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured coat with a plumed tail set high and flat. The top coat forms a ruff of fur on the neck, which Pomeranians are well known for, and they also have a fringe of feathery fur on the hindquarters. The earliest examples of this breed were white, occasionally brown or black. Queen Victoria adopted a small red Pomeranian in 1888, which caused that color to become fashionable by the end of the 19th century. Nowadays, the Pomeranian comes in the widest variety of colors of any dog breed, including white, black, brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black and tan, brown and tan, spotted, brindle, plus combinations of those colors. The most common colors are orange, black or cream/white.</p>

											<h1 >Corgi</h1>

											<p>There are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, each named for the county in Wales where it was originated. The two breeds were recognized as one breed until 1934 when the Kennel Club recognized them as Pembroke and Cardigan. The differences between the two breeds include bone structure, body length, and size. Cardigans are the larger of the two breeds, with large rounded ears and a 12-inch-long  flowing tail set in line with the body. Though the Cardigan is allowed in more colours than the Pembroke, white should not predominate in its coat. The Cardigan is a double-coated dog where the outer coat is dense, slightly harsh in texture, and of medium length. The dog's undercoat is short, soft, and thick. The breed stands about 30 cm at the shoulder, and weighs about 14 kg. The Cardigan is alert, active, intelligent, steady, and neither shy nor aggressive.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Golden Retriever</h3>
											<p>The Golden Retriever is a large breed with a dense, wavy coat. As a dog with origins in pedigree breeding, its widespread historical popularity, some regional variations have emerged in the breed. Therefore, the three subtypes of the Golden Retriever reflect the typical variations in dimensions and coat. However, all Golden Retrievers are blonde, yellow, or gold in colour and all subtypes are susceptible to the same health problems. Golden Retrievers are very smart dogs that are loyal and friendly to their owners.</p>
