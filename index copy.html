											<h1 >Corgi</h1>

											<p>There are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, each named for the county in Wales where it was originated. The two breeds were recognized as one breed until 1934 when the Kennel Club recognized them as Pembroke and Cardigan. The differences between the two breeds include bone structure, body length, and size. Cardigans are the larger of the two breeds, with large rounded ears and a 12-inch-long  flowing tail set in line with the body. Though the Cardigan is allowed in more colours than the Pembroke, white should not predominate in its coat. The Cardigan is a double-coated dog where the outer coat is dense, slightly harsh in texture, and of medium length. The dog's undercoat is short, soft, and thick. The breed stands about 30 cm at the shoulder, and weighs about 14 kg. The Cardigan is alert, active, intelligent, steady, and neither shy nor aggressive.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Golden Retriver</h3>
											<p>The Golden Retriever is a large breed with a dense, wavy coat. As a dog with origins in pedigree breeding, its widespread historical popularity, some regional variations have emerged in the breed. Therefore, the three subtypes of the Golden Retriever reflect the typical variations in dimensions and coat. However, all Golden Retrievers are blonde, yellow, or gold in colour and all subtypes are susceptible to the same health problems. Golden Retrievers are very smart dogs that are loyal and friendly to their owners.</p>
